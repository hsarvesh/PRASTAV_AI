**IT Infrastructure Support Solution Proposal**

**Executive Summary:**
Our proposal outlines a comprehensive IT infrastructure support solution to meet the requirements of 100 physical hosts, 300 network devices, 4000 TB of HP Storage, and 1000 VMs spread across 20 regions with an SLA of 90%. Our team has conducted thorough analysis and planning to ensure that all aspects of the project are thoroughly addressed.

**Project Analysis:**
Our team has assessed the current IT infrastructure and identified areas for improvement. The current infrastructure is outdated and lacks robust security measures, which can lead to data breaches and downtime. We have also analyzed the existing storage capacity, network devices, and virtual machines (VMs) to ensure that our solution meets the requirements of the project.

**Project Plan:**
Our proposal outlines a five-phase approach to deliver the IT infrastructure support solution:

### Phase 1: Planning and Design (February 2023 - March 2023)

* Conduct thorough analysis of the current IT infrastructure
* Develop a comprehensive plan for implementing the new infrastructure
* Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies

### Phase 2: Procurement and Ordering (March 2023 - April 2023)

* Source physical hosts, network devices, HP Storage, and VMs from reputable vendors
* Ensure compliance with ITIL standards and regulatory requirements
* Develop a plan for inventory management and tracking

### Phase 3: Deployment and Installation (April 2023 - May 2023)

* Deploy and install new infrastructure components
* Conduct thorough testing and validation of all components
* Develop a plan for training support personnel on the new infrastructure

### Phase 4: Testing and Validation (May 2023 - June 2023)

* Conduct comprehensive testing of all components to ensure compliance with ITIL standards
* Identify potential issues and develop mitigation strategies
* Develop a plan for continuous monitoring and maintenance

### Phase 5: Go-Live and Training (June 2023 - July 2023)

* Deploy the new infrastructure in production environment
* Provide comprehensive training to support personnel on the new infrastructure
* Conduct post-deployment testing and validation

**Deliverables:**

1. **Physical Hosts Configuration and Maintenance:** Schedule regular backups and disaster recovery testing, implement robust security measures, conduct quarterly server audits, and develop a plan for server upgrades.
2. **Network Device Verification and Maintenance:** Conduct regular network monitoring, schedule routine maintenance and upgrades, develop a plan for network device replacement and upgrade procedures.
3. **Storage Management System Implementation:** Implement a robust storage management system to monitor and maintain storage capacity, develop a plan for data backup and recovery procedures, conduct regular storage audits.
4. **Virtual Machine Provisioning and Configuration:** Verify that all 1000 VMs are properly provisioned, configured, and maintained, conduct regular VM monitoring, develop a plan for VM deployment and upgrade procedures.
5. **Region-Specific IT Infrastructure Support:** Ensure each region has a fully functional IT infrastructure in place, verify the SLA of 90% is being met, develop a plan to address any regional issues or discrepancies.

**Assumptions:**

1. The current IT infrastructure will be upgraded and modernized as part of this project.
2. All necessary personnel have been trained on the new infrastructure.
3. The vendor provided equipment and services meet all requirements specified in the RFP.

**Risks:**
1. Delays in procurement and delivery of equipment and services
2. Inadequate training for support personnel
3. Insufficient budget for project scope

**Mitigation Strategies:**

1. Regular communication with vendors to ensure timely delivery
2. Comprehensive training program for support personnel
3. Budget adjustments as necessary to accommodate changes in project scope

**Budget:** $500,000

**Timeline:** Seven months from project commencement to completion.

By following this plan, we can ensure that the IT infrastructure support solution is delivered on time, within budget, and meets the required SLA of 90%.
