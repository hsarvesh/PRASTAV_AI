**Detailed Proposal for IT Operational Support Solution**

**Executive Summary:**
The proposed solution aims to design and implement a new IT operational support solution that meets the organization's requirements. The current state assessment reveals that the existing infrastructure is outdated and cannot meet the growing demands of the organization.

**Project Analysis:**
The project analysis has identified the following key issues with the current infrastructure:

* Insufficient resources (physical hosts, network devices, HP Storage) to support growing demands
* Outdated virtualization platform (VMware vSphere 6.0) that is no longer supported and lacks advanced features
* Inadequate backup and disaster recovery processes

The proposed solution addresses these issues by:

* Designing and implementing a new IT operational support solution with 30 physical hosts, 30 network devices, 40 TB of HP Storage, and 400 VMs
* Implementing a new virtualization platform (VMware vSphere 7.0) that meets advanced features and security requirements
* Providing comprehensive backup and disaster recovery processes

**Project Plan:**

The project plan is divided into four phases:

1. **Design and Planning Phase (Weeks 1-4)**:
	* Conduct a thorough analysis of the current infrastructure and identify requirements for the new solution
	* Design the new physical hosts, network devices, HP Storage, and virtualization platform
	* Create detailed documentation of the proposed solution
2. **Implementation and Testing Phase (Weeks 5-8)**:
	* Implement the new physical hosts, network devices, HP Storage, and virtualization platform
	* Test and validate the new infrastructure and virtualization platform to ensure compatibility and performance
	* Conduct thorough testing of backup and disaster recovery processes
3. **Deployment and Training Phase (Weeks 9-10)**:
	* Deploy the final solution and conduct post-deployment activities
	* Provide comprehensive training to IT personnel on the new solution
	* Document lessons learned and identify areas for improvement
4. **Post-Implementation Phase (Weeks 11-12)**:
	* Conduct regular backups and disaster recovery exercises
	* Monitor performance of the new infrastructure and virtualization platform

**Deliverables:**

The proposed solution will deliver the following:

* 30 physical hosts with a minimum of 2 CPUs, 8 GB RAM, and 256 GB storage each
* 30 network devices, including routers, switches, firewalls, and load balancers
* 40 TB of HP Storage with a minimum of 4 TB SSD and 36 TB HDD capacity
* 400 VMs on the new virtualization platform (VMware vSphere 7.0)
* Comprehensive backup and disaster recovery processes

**Assumptions:**

The following assumptions have been made:

* The organization will provide necessary resources (budget, personnel) to support the project
* The proposed solution meets the organization's requirements for IT operational support
* The virtualization platform (VMware vSphere 7.0) is compatible with the existing infrastructure

**Risks:**

The following risks have been identified:

* Delays in implementation due to insufficient resources or unforeseen issues
* Incompatibility between the proposed solution and the existing infrastructure
* Failure of backup and disaster recovery processes

**Timeline:**
The project timeline is 12 weeks, broken down as follows:

Weeks 1-4: Design and Planning Phase
Weeks 5-8: Implementation and Testing Phase
Weeks 9-10: Deployment and Training Phase
Weeks 11-12: Post-Implementation Phase

	+ Week 6: Test and validate the new infrastructure and virtualization platform (25 hours)
	+ Week 7: Conduct thorough testing of backup and disaster recovery processes (15 hours)
	+ Week 8: Review test results and make necessary adjustments (10 hours)
* Deployment and training phase:
	+ Week 9: Deploy the final solution and conduct post-deployment activities (18 hours)
	+ Week 10: Provide comprehensive training to IT personnel on the new solution (20 hours)

**Budget Breakdown:**
The budget breakdown is as follows:

* Physical hosts, network devices, HP Storage: $150,000
* Virtualization platform (VMware vSphere 7.0): $100,000
* Training and miscellaneous: $50,000
Total budget: $300,000
