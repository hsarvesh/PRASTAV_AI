**Detailed Proposal for IT Operational Support Project**

I. **Project Analysis**

The proposed project aims to upgrade and modernize the organization's IT infrastructure to improve efficiency, scalability, and reliability. The current state of the infrastructure is as follows:

* Physical Hosts: 30 hosts running on bare-metal servers
* Network Devices: 30 devices managed with Cisco equipment
* HP Storage: 40 TB of storage capacity using Storage Array A
* Virtual Machines: 400 VMs running on VMware vSphere

The proposed project will upgrade the physical hosts to virtualized environments, deploy new and used network devices, expand the HP storage capacity, and consolidate virtual machines.

II. **Project Planning Details**

The project timeline is divided into three phases:

1. Planning Phase (January 1st, 2023 - February 10th, 2023): This phase includes project planning, resource allocation, and stakeholder management.
2. Deployment Phase (February 15th, 2023 - April 15th, 2023): This phase involves the deployment of new physical hosts, network devices, HP storage, and virtual machines.
3. Testing and Validation Phase (April 16th, 2023 - May 10th, 2023): This phase includes testing and validation of the upgraded infrastructure.

The project resources include:

* Project Manager
* Systems Engineers (10)
* Network Engineers (5)
* Storage Administrators (2)
* Virtualization Specialists (10)

**Assumptions:**

1. The organization will provide necessary funding for the project.
2. The stakeholders will cooperate and provide necessary input during the project planning phase.
3. The vendors will deliver products and services on time.

**Risks:**

1. Delays in vendor delivery: 20%
2. Insufficient resources: 30%
3. Technical issues with new equipment: 40%

**Deliverables:**

1. Upgraded physical hosts (10 x New Servers, 5 x Upgraded Servers, 15 x Virtualized Servers)
2. Deployed network devices (10 x New Switches, 5 x Used Switches, 15 x Router Upgrades)
3. Expanded HP storage capacity (20 TB x Additional Storage, 10 TB x Backup Storage, 10 TB x Archive Storage)
4. Consolidated virtual machines (100 x New VMs, 50 x Upgraded VMs, 200 x Consolidated VMs)

**Worklog Level Details:**

1. Activity 1.1: Purchase and provision new servers (5 days)
	* Estimated resource allocation: 10 hours/day
2. Activity 1.2: Upgrade existing servers (7 days)
	* Estimated resource allocation: 14 hours/day
3. Activity 1.3: Virtualize physical hosts (10 days)
	* Estimated resource allocation: 16 hours/day
4. Activity 2.1: Purchase and deploy new switches (8 days)
	* Estimated resource allocation: 12 hours/day
5. Activity 2.2: Upgrade existing routers (12 days)
	* Estimated resource allocation: 18 hours/day
6. Activity 2.3: Consolidate network devices (15 days)
	* Estimated resource allocation: 20 hours/day
7. Activity 3.1: Purchase and deploy additional storage (6 days)
	* Estimated resource allocation: 10 hours/day
8. Activity 3.2: Configure backup storage (8 days)
	* Estimated resource allocation: 12 hours/day
9. Activity 3.3: Configure archive storage (10 days)
	* Estimated resource allocation: 14 hours/day
10. Activity 4.1: Purchase and provision new VMs (15 days)
	* Estimated resource allocation: 18 hours/day
11. Activity 4.2: Upgrade existing VMs (20 days)
	* Estimated resource allocation: 22 hours/day
12. Activity 4.3: Consolidate VMs (30 days)
	* Estimated resource allocation: 24 hours/day

**Project Timeline:**

| Phase | Start Date | End Date | Duration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Planning | January 1st, 2023 | February 10th, 2023 | 40 days |
| Deployment | February 15th, 2023 | April 15th, 2023 | 60 days |
| Testing and Validation | April 16th, 2023 | May 10th, 2023 | 15 days |

Note: The estimated resource allocation is based on a full-time effort of 8 hours/day for each activity.
