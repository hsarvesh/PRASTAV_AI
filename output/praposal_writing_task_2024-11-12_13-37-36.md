The detailed proposal for the deployment of a comprehensive IT environment solution for 300 physical hosts, 470 network devices, 30 firewalls, 60 routers, 60 riverbed, 550 TB of HP Storage, and 14000 VMs, Citrix solution for different application environments is as follows:

**Project Analysis:**

The project aims to deploy a comprehensive IT environment solution that meets the ITIL standards. The solution will consist of 300 physical hosts, 470 network devices, 30 firewalls, 60 routers, 60 riverbed, 550 TB of HP Storage, and 14000 VMs, Citrix solution for different application environments.

**Project Planning Details:**

The project will be divided into three phases: planning, execution, and deployment. The planning phase (Weeks 1-4) involves completing the physical host inventory, network device inventory, firewall inventory, router inventory, riverbed inventory, and storage inventory. The execution phase (Weeks 5-12) involves installing and configuring Citrix servers, network devices, firewalls, routers, and storage devices. The deployment phase (Weeks 13-16) involves conducting unit testing and integration testing.

**Timelines and Duration:**

The project timeline is as follows:

* Start Date: Week 1
* End Date: Week 16
* Duration: 16 weeks

**Resource Allocation:**

The resource allocation plan includes the following personnel, equipment, and budget:

* Personnel:
	+ Project Manager
	+ Technical Leads
	+ Resource Allocation Team
* Equipment:
	+ Laptops
	+ Projectors
	+ Necessary tools for inventory management and Citrix implementation
* Budget:
	+ $500,000 (allocated for equipment, personnel, and miscellaneous expenses)

**Assumptions:**

The following assumptions are made:

* The physical host inventory, network device inventory, firewall inventory, router inventory, riverbed inventory, and storage inventory will be completed within the planning phase.
* The Citrix servers, network devices, firewalls, routers, and storage devices will be installed and configured correctly during the execution phase.
* The unit testing and integration testing will be conducted successfully during the deployment phase.

**Risks:**

The following risks are identified:

* Risk 1: Delays in hardware delivery - Mitigation strategy: Develop a contingency plan for delayed hardware delivery.
* Risk 2: Incompatibility issues with new environments - Mitigation strategy: Conduct thorough compatibility testing before deployment.

**Deliverables:**

The deliverables of the project include:

* A comprehensive IT environment solution that meets the ITIL standards
* 300 physical hosts, 470 network devices, 30 firewalls, 60 routers, 60 riverbed, and 550 TB of HP Storage
* 14000 VMs, Citrix solution for different application environments
