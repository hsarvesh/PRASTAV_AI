**Project Proposal for IT Infrastructure Refresh**

**1. Project Overview:**
The proposed project aims to refresh and optimize the existing IT infrastructure to meet the specified requirements and standards, including ITIL Version 3. The scope includes assessing, planning, executing, testing, monitoring, and supporting the deployment of 400 Servers (350 Windows, 50 Linux), 5 HP Storage solutions, 30 Network Devices, 4000 TB of storage, 1000 Virtual Machines (VMs) across 20 regions, with a Service Level Agreement (SLA) of 90%.

**2. Project Phases:**
- **Planning and Assessment Phase:** Conduct a thorough assessment of current infrastructure to identify gaps and align resources with ITIL standards.
- **Execution Phase:** Deploy the servers, storage, network devices, and VMs across regions.
- **Testing Phase:** Validate each component meets SLA requirements.
- **Monitoring and Maintenance Phase:** Implement continuous monitoring and maintenance for optimal performance and uptime.
- **Post-Implementation Support:** Ensure all systems are stable and address any issues that arise post-deployment.

**3. Resource Planning:**
- **Staffing Requirements:** 
  - Server Administrators: 5 (2 Windows, 2 Linux, 1 Multi-platform)
  - Storage Administrators: 2
  - Network Engineers: 4
  - Virtual Machine Administrators: 10
  - Tools: Ansible, Puppet, Chef for automation.

- **Training Needs:** Ensure staff are trained in ITIL standards and the specific tools used.

**4. Budget Considerations:**
- **Hardware Costs:** Estimate based on server specs (e.g., high-end for Windows), storage solutions, network devices.
- **Software Costs:** Licensing for OS, tools, monitoring platforms.
- **Cloud/Hosting Costs:** VM hosting across regions.

**5. Timeline:**
- **Planning Phase:** 2 months
- **Execution Phase:** 4 months
- **Testing Phase:** 1 month
- **Monitoring & Maintenance:** Ongoing, with post-implementation support for at least 3 months

**6. Risk Management:**
- Develop redundancy and disaster recovery plans.
- Consider failover strategies across regions.

**7. Stakeholder Engagement:**
- Regular updates to stakeholders, including IT teams and management, to ensure alignment and feedback.

This proposal outlines a structured approach to refresh the IT infrastructure, ensuring it meets SLA requirements, adheres to ITIL standards, and is efficiently managed post-deployment.
