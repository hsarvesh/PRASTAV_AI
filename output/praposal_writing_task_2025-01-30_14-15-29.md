Detailed IT Infrastructure Proposal**

---

### **Executive Summary**

This proposal outlines a structured approach to deploying and managing an advanced IT infrastructure across 20 regions. The solution aims to support 1000 Virtual Machines (VMs) on 400 Servers, with 350 running Windows and 50 Linux operating systems, alongside 5 HP Storage devices. The project ensures high availability, security, and scalability, adhering to a 90% Service Level Agreement (SLA). The plan is divided into six phases, each addressing specific objectives while considering technical, operational, and compliance requirements.
