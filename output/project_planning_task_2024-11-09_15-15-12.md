**Project Plan for IT Operational Support Solution**

The project aims to design an IT operational support solution that meets the following requirements:

* 30 physical hosts
* 30 network devices
* 40 TB of HP Storage
* 400 VMs

**Current State Assessment**

An assessment of the current state reveals that the existing infrastructure is outdated and cannot meet the growing demands of the organization. The current setup consists of:

* 20 physical hosts with varying levels of performance and capacity
* 15 network devices, including routers, switches, and firewalls
* 10 TB of storage capacity on HP Storage
* 100 VMs running on an outdated virtualization platform

**Project Scope**

The project scope includes designing and implementing a new IT operational support solution that meets the following requirements:

* 30 physical hosts with a minimum of 2 CPUs, 8 GB RAM, and 256 GB storage each
* 30 network devices, including routers, switches, firewalls, and load balancers
* 40 TB of HP Storage with a minimum of 4 TB SSD and 36 TB HDD capacity
* 400 VMs running on a new virtualization platform with a minimum of 8 cores, 16 GB RAM, and 256 GB storage each

**Project Timeline**

The project is expected to take 12 weeks to complete, with the following milestones:

* Week 1-2: Assessment of current infrastructure and identification of requirements
* Week 3-4: Design and planning phase (30 physical hosts, 30 network devices, 40 TB of HP Storage)
* Week 5-6: Virtualization platform design and implementation (400 VMs)
* Week 7-10: Implementation and testing of the new infrastructure
* Week 11-12: Deployment of the final solution and post-deployment activities

**Project Resources**

The project will require the following resources:

* 2 experienced IT professionals with expertise in virtualization, networking, and storage
* 1 IT service manager to oversee the project and ensure successful delivery
* 10 days of training for end-users on the new system
* Budget for equipment, software, and personnel costs
