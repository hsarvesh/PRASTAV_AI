**Detailed Report for Deployment for IT Environment Project**

The project aims to deploy a comprehensive IT environment solution for 300 physical hosts, 470 network devices, 30 firewalls, 60 routers, 60 riverbed, 550 TB of HP Storage, and 14000 VMs, Citrix solution for different application environments, to meet the ITIL standards. The project will be divided into three phases: planning, execution, and deployment.

**Phase 1: Planning (Weeks 1-4)**

	+ Task 1.3: Firewall Inventory is ongoing.
	+ Task 1.4: Router Inventory is ongoing.
	+ Task 1.5: Riverbed Inventory is ongoing.
	+ Task 1.6: Storage Inventory was completed.
* Week 2-3:
	+ Task 2.1: Review existing Citrix infrastructure is ongoing.
	+ Task 2.2: Assess compatibility with new environments is ongoing.
	+ Task 2.3: Identify potential integration points was completed.
* Week 4:
	+ Task 3.1: Resource allocation plan was completed.
	+ Task 3.2: Critical path method was completed.

**Phase 2: Execution (Weeks 5-12)**

* Weeks 5-8:
	+ Task 4.1: Network Device Inventory was completed.
	+ Task 4.2: Firewall Inventory was completed.
	+ Task 4.3: Router Inventory was completed.
* Weeks 9-12:
	+ Task 5.1: Install and configure Citrix servers is ongoing.
	+ Task 5.2: Configure Citrix clients is ongoing.

**Phase 3: Deployment (Weeks 13-16)**

* Weeks 13-14:
	+ Task 6.1: Install and configure storage devices was completed.
	+ Task 6.2: Configure storage connections was completed.
* Week 15:
	+ Task 7.1: Conduct unit testing is ongoing.
	+ Task 7.2: Conduct integration testing is ongoing.

**Project Timeline:**

Start Date: Week 1
End Date: Week 16

**Duration:** 16 weeks

**Resource Allocation:**

* Personnel: Project Manager, Technical Leads, and Resource Allocation Team
* Equipment: Laptops, projectors, and necessary tools for inventory management and Citrix implementation
* Budget: $500,000 (allocated for equipment, personnel, and miscellaneous expenses)

**Risk Management:**

* Risk 1: Delays in hardware delivery - Mitigation strategy: Develop a contingency plan for delayed hardware delivery.
* Risk 2: Incompatibility issues with new environments - Mitigation strategy: Conduct thorough compatibility testing before deployment.

**Quality Assurance:**

* Quality assurance protocols will be implemented to ensure all work meets ITIL standards.

The project timeline and resource allocation are critical components of the overall project plan. The project manager must closely monitor the progress of each phase and adjust the plan as necessary to ensure timely completion. Regular communication with stakeholders, including team members, customers, and vendors, is essential to ensure that everyone is informed and aligned with the project's progress.

Additionally, risk management is a crucial aspect of the project. Identifying potential risks and developing mitigation strategies will help minimize their impact on the overall project outcome. Conducting thorough compatibility testing before deployment will also help prevent incompatibility issues with new environments.

By implementing quality assurance protocols, the project can ensure that all work meets ITIL standards, providing a high-quality solution for the organization.
