**Proposal for IT Infrastructure Refresh Project**  

---

### **Executive Summary**  
This proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to refresh and optimize the organization's IT infrastructure, ensuring compliance with ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library) standards and delivering high service levels. The project will modernize server, storage, and network capabilities, while enhancing operational efficiency through robust monitoring and maintenance processes.  

---

### **Project Objectives**  
1. **Infrastructure Modernization**: Upgrade and expand the existing IT infrastructure to support current and future business needs.  
2. **Compliance with ITIL Standards**: Ensure that all operations align with ITIL best practices for efficient IT service management.  
3. **High Availability and Performance**: Achieve 99% uptime, optimized resource utilization, and reduced latency across all systems.  
4. **Cost Efficiency**: Implement cost-effective solutions while minimizing downtime and ensuring smooth transitions during the refresh process.

### **Project Overview**  
The IT Infrastructure Refresh Project will cover the following key components:  
- **Servers**: 400 servers (350 Windows-based, 50 Linux-based).  
- **Storage**: 800 TB of HP storage solutions (including cloud integration for scalability).  
- **Network**: Upgrade network infrastructure to support high-speed data transmission and inter-region connectivity.  
- **Monitoring Tools**: Implement real-time monitoring systems (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix) with failover mechanisms.

### **Phased Approach**  

#### **Phase 1: Planning and Assessment (Month 1)**  
- Conduct a detailed assessment of current IT infrastructure, identifying gaps and bottlenecks.  
- Define project milestones, timelines, and resource requirements.  
- Develop a risk management plan to address potential challenges such as supply chain delays or personnel shortages.  
- Stakeholder engagement: Regular updates with IT teams and management to ensure alignment.  

#### **Phase 2: Execution (Months 2-4)**  
- **Server Refresh**: Decommission outdated servers, install new hardware, and migrate applications with minimal downtime.  
- **Storage Expansion**: Scale HP storage solutions to support 800 TB of data, including disaster recovery backups.  
- **Network Optimization**: Upgrade network infrastructure to ensure high-speed communication between regions.  
- **Automation Tools**: Implement automation tools (e.g., Ansible, Puppet) for repeatable deployment processes.  

#### **Phase 3: Testing (Month 5)**  
- Perform rigorous testing of servers, storage, and network performance under simulated real-world loads.  
- Validate system uptime, response times, and resource utilization.  
- Set up monitoring tools with alerts for critical thresholds.  

#### **Phase 4: Monitoring and Maintenance (Ongoing)**  
- Continuously monitor system health using real-time tools and alerting systems.  
- Schedule routine maintenance, including patch management, backups, and updates.  
- Provide post-deployment support to address any issues promptly, ensuring SLA compliance.  
- Train IT staff on ITIL processes and system operations to ensure smooth transitions.

### **Key Assumptions**  
1. The organization will provide necessary resources (e.g., funding, personnel) for the project.  
2. No major disruptions to business operations during server decommissioning or network upgrades.  
3. Successful implementation of automation tools without significant resistance from IT staff.  

---

### **Deliverables**  
- Fully operational IT infrastructure meeting ITIL standards.  
- High availability (99% uptime) and optimized resource utilization.  
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting systems in place.  
- Trained IT staff ready to manage the updated infrastructure.  

---

### **Risk Management**  
1. **Redundancy Issues**: Implement failover plans for servers and storage to minimize downtime.  
2. **Disaster Recovery Challenges**: Develop cross-region disaster recovery strategies with regular testing.  
3. **Supply Chain Delays**: Maintain a contingency plan for hardware procurement delays.  

---

### **Conclusion**  
This proposal presents a structured approach to refreshing and optimizing the IT infrastructure, ensuring alignment with ITIL standards and delivering high service levels. By adhering to this plan, the organization will achieve a robust, scalable, and efficient IT environment.
