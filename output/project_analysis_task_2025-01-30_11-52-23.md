Proposal for IT Infrastructure Refresh Project**

---

**1. Executive Summary:**
The IT Infrastructure Refresh Project aims to modernize and optimize existing systems to meet specific requirements aligned with ITIL Version 3 standards. The scope encompasses refreshing 400 Servers (350 Windows, 50 Linux), deploying 5 HP Storage solutions, updating 30 Network Devices, managing 1000 VMs across 20 regions, ensuring a 90% SLA, and establishing robust monitoring and maintenance processes.

**2. Project Objectives:**
- **Assessment:** Evaluate current infrastructure to identify gaps.
- **Planning:** Define target configurations aligned with ITIL standards.
- **Execution:** Deploy servers, storage, network devices, and VMs across regions.
- **Testing:** Validate SLA compliance.
- **Monitoring & Maintenance:** Implement continuous monitoring and routine maintenance.
- **Transition:** Ensure smooth handover to permanent IT staff.

**3. Detailed Plan:**

### A. Planning and Assessment Phase (Duration: 2 Months)
1. **Inventory and Assessment:**
   - Conduct a comprehensive inventory of servers, storage, and network devices.
   - Assess current configurations against target requirements, focusing on OS versioning, hardware specs, and redundancy.

2. **ITIL Implementation:**
   - Deploy an ITSM system (e.g., ServiceNow) for incident management, change requests, and problem tracking.
   - Define service levels, roles, and responsibilities based on ITIL standards.

3. **Target Configuration:**
   - Determine target OS versions for each server type.
   - Plan VM deployment across regions, considering workload distribution and redundancy.
   - Identify high-availability and disaster-recovery strategies for critical systems.

### B. Execution Phase (Duration: 4 Months)
1. **Server Deployment:**
   - Sequence installations, starting with critical systems.
   - Configure servers to meet target specs, including security patches and updates.

2. **Storage Implementation:**
   - Deploy HP storage solutions, ensuring scalability and redundancy.
   - Distribute 4000 TB storage across primary, backup, and archive solutions.

3. **Network Configuration:**
   - Deploy and configure switches and routers according to network topology.
   - Use automation tools (e.g., Ansible) for efficient configurations.

4. **VM Deployment:**
   - Install VMs across regions, ensuring allocated resources meet workload requirements.
   - Implement redundancy and disaster-recovery plans for VMs.

### C. Testing Phase (Duration: 1 Month)
1. **Performance Testing:**
   - Validate server uptime, response times, and resource usage.
   - Test storage IOPS, latency, and network throughput/latency between regions.
   - Check VM boot time, resource usage, and stability.

2. **Monitoring Tools Setup:**
   - Implement monitoring systems (e.g., Nagios, Zabbix) with alerts for performance thresholds.

### D. Monitoring and Maintenance Phase (Ongoing)
1. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Use real-time tools to monitor system health and performance.
   - Set up alerting systems for critical issues.

2. **Routine Maintenance:**
   - Schedule patch management, backups, and updates to ensure system reliability.

3. **Post-Deployment Support:**
   - Address post-deployment issues promptly to maintain SLA compliance.
   - Provide training for IT staff on system operations and ITIL processes.

### E. Resource Planning
1. **Staffing:**
   - Determine roles (e.g., Server Admins, Storage Engineers) with defined responsibilities.
   - Train staff on ITIL and automation tools.

2. **Budget Considerations:**
   - Estimate costs for hardware, software licensing, cloud services, and maintenance.

### F. Risk Management
1. **Redundancy and Disaster Recovery:**
   - Implement failover plans for servers and storage to minimize downtime.
   - Develop disaster-recovery strategies across regions.

2. **Mitigation Strategies:**
   - Plan for supply chain delays in hardware procurement and personnel availability.

### G. Stakeholder Engagement
- Regular updates to IT teams and management ensure alignment and feedback throughout the project.
