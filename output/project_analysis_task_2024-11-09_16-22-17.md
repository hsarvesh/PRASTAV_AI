Here is a comprehensive report detailing our project with 30 physical hosts, 30 network devices, 40 TB of HP Storage, and 400 VMs, designed to complete the project as per requirements:

**Comprehensive Report for IT Operational Support Project**

The goal of this project is to ensure that all hardware components are properly maintained, upgraded, and managed. This report details our approach to complete the following tasks:
- **Physical Hosts (30)**: 
  - Task Summary: Inventory and categorization.
  - Resource Requirements: 10 personnel from IT Operational Support team.
  - Timeline: Week 1-2

**Network Devices (30)**: 
  - Task Summary: Upgrade and replace outdated devices.
  - Resource Requirements: 2 external vendors.
  - Timeline: Week 3-4

**HP Storage (40 TB)**:
  - Task Summary: Increase storage capacity by 20 TB.
  - Resource Requirements: 2 external vendors.
  - Timeline: Week 5-6

**Virtual Machines (400)**
  - Task Summary: Optimize VM management and virtualization efficiency.
  - Resource Requirements: 10 personnel from IT Operational Support team.
  - Timeline: Week 7-8

Our project involves the following activities:
1. Physical Host Inventory: Gather detailed information about each physical host, including hardware configuration, software versions, and network connections.

2. Categorize Physical Hosts: Prioritize maintenance and upgrades based on roles and functions to minimize downtime on critical systems.

3. Network Upgrade/Replacement: Identify outdated devices requiring updates or replacements to ensure security and functionality.

4. Storage Capacity Increase: Expand storage capacity by 20 TB for HP Storage to enhance data management, reduce risk of data loss, and improve system performance.

5. VM Management Optimization: Review each VM configuration to ensure optimal resource usage and meet required capacity, enhancing overall system efficiency.

**Project Timeline**: This project will be completed in eight weeks (Weeks 1-8) with a detailed plan for each week.

**Budget Allocation**: Resources will include personnel from the IT Operational Support team and external vendors for hardware upgrades and storage expansion. The budget will cover these costs to ensure successful completion of the project.

**ITIL Compliance**: This project aims to meet ITIL standards by following established best practices in IT service management, ensuring efficient operation and maintenance of all components.

By carefully planning each task and allocating necessary resources, this comprehensive approach ensures that our IT Operational Support project is completed effectively, meeting the requirements for 30 physical hosts, 30 network devices, 40 TB of HP Storage, and 400 VMs.
