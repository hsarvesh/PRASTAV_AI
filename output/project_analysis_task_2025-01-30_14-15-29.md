IT Infrastructure Project Plan**

---

### **Project Overview**

The project aims to design and implement an optimized IT infrastructure supporting:
- **400 Servers** (350 Windows, 50 Linux)
- **5 HP Storage Devices**
- **30 Network Devices**
- **4000 TB Storage Capacity**
- **1000 Virtual Machines (VMs) across 20 Regions**

### **Phased Approach**

#### **Phase 1: Assessment and Initial Planning (4 Weeks)**

1. **Server Assessment**:
   - Categorize servers by role (e.g., application, database).
   - Collect inventory data for each server.

2. **Storage Review**:
   - Analyze current storage utilization vs. required capacity.
   - Identify gaps for expansion or optimization.

3. **Network Evaluation**:
   - Test bandwidth and connectivity across all 30 devices.
   - Ensure redundancy and failover mechanisms are functional.

4. **Dependency Management**:
   - Prioritize testing of critical components to avoid delays.

#### **Phase 2: Design and Preparations (4 Weeks)**

1. **Capacity Planning**:
   - Determine VM requirements per region based on workload projections.
   - Calculate needed CPU, memory, and storage per region.

2. **Redundancy and High Availability**:
   - Implement backup solutions for servers and storage.
   - Ensure failover mechanisms are in place for critical systems.

3. **Virtualization Strategy**:
   - Choose hypervisors (e.g., vSphere) that align with existing tools.
   - Plan VM distribution across regions considering traffic patterns.

4. **Security and Compliance**:
   - Enforce access control lists per region.
   - Ensure compliance with data sovereignty regulations.

#### **Phase 3: Implementation (6 Weeks)**

1. **Server Deployment**:
   - Deploy servers in batches, prioritizing by region to minimize impact.

2. **Storage Expansion**:
   - Add or upgrade storage devices as needed to meet capacity requirements.

3. **Network Configuration**:
   - Optimize network topology based on traffic analysis.
   - Implement quality of service (QoS) for critical applications.

4. **VM Migration and Testing**:
   - Migrate VMs to new environments while ensuring minimal downtime.
   - Conduct initial performance and security testing.

#### **Phase 4: Testing (2 Weeks)**

1. **Performance Testing**:
   - Stress-test servers, storage, and network components.
   - Use automation tools to simulate traffic and identify bottlenecks.

2. **High Availability Testing**:
   - Verify failover mechanisms across regions.
   - Ensure quick recovery times for critical systems.

3. **Security Testing**:
   - Conduct security audits for each component.
   - Test internal and external access controls.

#### **Phase 5: Decommissioning and Handover (1 Week)**

1. **Decommission Old Infrastructure**:
   - Shut down and decommission outdated servers and storage.
   - Archive data as per retention policies.

2. **IT Team Training**:
   - Conduct hands-on workshops on server management and troubleshooting.
   - Provide detailed documentation on network topology, configurations, and maintenance procedures.

3. **Final Sign-Off**:
   - Confirm that all systems are operational and compliant with standards.
   - Handover documentation and access to the new infrastructure.

#### **Phase 6: Ongoing Management (Ongoing)**

1. **Monitoring and Alerting**:
   - Implement real-time monitoring tools covering all regions.
   - Set up alerts for critical metrics like CPU usage, latency, and disk health.

2. **Regular Updates and Patches**:
   - Apply updates and patches to maintain security and performance.
   - Schedule maintenance windows for updates without impacting operations.

3. **Continuous Improvement**:
   - Collect feedback from IT teams for ongoing improvements.
   - Optimize configurations based on performance metrics and user feedback.

### **Key Considerations**

- **Implementation Strategy**: Roll out resources per region to minimize impact on operations.
- **Budget Constraints**: Prioritize cost-effective solutions without compromising redundancy or security.
- **Compliance and Security**: Ensure adherence to industry standards, especially for data sovereignty across regions.
- **Automation Tools**: Utilize automation scripts for testing and monitoring to enhance efficiency.

### **Conclusion**

This phased approach ensures a comprehensive implementation of the new IT infrastructure, addressing both current and future needs while maintaining operational integrity.
