**Project Overview:**

We are tasked with planning and managing the supporting IT infrastructure projects for the following resources:

- **Servers:** 400 (350 Windows, 50 Linux)
- **Storage Devices:** 5 HP Storage
- **Network Devices:** 30
- **Total Storage Capacity:** 4000 TB
- **Virtual Machines (VMs):** 1000
- **Regions Covered:** 20
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** 90%

### Project Phases and Timeline:

#### Phase 1: Assessment and Initial Planning

**Objective:** Gather information about the current state of IT infrastructure, identify gaps, and create a project plan.

- **Tasks:**
  - **Server Assessment:** Review each server's hardware and software configuration, checking for updates, security patches, and performance metrics.
  - **Storage Review:** Inspect HP storage devices for capacity, redundancy, and data integrity.
  - **Network Evaluation:** Test network devices to ensure they meet the required bandwidth and connectivity standards.
  - **VM Analysis:** Audit existing VMs to identify resource allocation issues and over/under-provisioning.

- **Duration:** 4 weeks
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Key Resources:** IT team, external consultants (if needed), monitoring tools

**Outcome:** A comprehensive report detailing the current state of infrastructure and areas needing intervention.

#### Phase 2: Design and Preparations

**Objective:** Create a design document outlining the necessary changes to meet the SLA requirements and ITIL standards.

- **Tasks:**
  - **Capacity Planning:** Calculate the required number of servers, storage, and network devices based on current workload and future projections.
  - **Redundancy Design:** Ensure that critical components (e.g., servers, storage) have redundancy to meet the 90% SLA.
  - **Virtualization Strategy:** Optimize VM configurations, implement necessary automation tools for resource management.

- **Duration:** 3 weeks
- **Dependencies:** Phase 1 report, budget approval
- **Key Resources:** IT architects, network engineers, procurement team

**Outcome:** A detailed design document with recommendations for upgrades and optimizations.

#### Phase 3: Implementation

**Objective:** Execute the necessary infrastructure changes to meet the project objectives.

- **Tasks:**
  - **Server Replacement/Upgrade:** Replace outdated servers with modern configurations (e.g., scalable, energy-efficient).
  - **Storage Expansion:** Increase storage capacity as needed to support VMs and data growth.
  - **Network Optimization:** Upgrade or configure network devices for better performance and redundancy.
  - **VM Migration:** Move VMs to new hosts or regions as per the design.

- **Duration:** 6 weeks
- **Dependencies:** Design document, procurement approval, test environment availability
- **Key Resources:** IT engineers, contractors (if needed), change management team

**Outcome:** Fully operational infrastructure meeting the required SLA and ITIL standards.

#### Phase 4: Testing and Validation

**Objective:** Validate that the new infrastructure meets performance, reliability, and scalability requirements.

- **Tasks:**
  - **Performance Testing:** Stress-test servers, storage, and network to ensure they handle peak loads.
  - **High Availability Testing:** Ensure redundancy and failover mechanisms are working as expected.
  - **Security Testing:** Verify that all components meet security best practices and compliance standards.

- **Duration:** 2 weeks
- **Dependencies:** Implementation phase completion, test environment decommissioning
- **Key Resources:** Testing team, automation tools

**Outcome:** A validated infrastructure ready for production use.

#### Phase 5: Decommissioning and Handover

**Objective:** Transition the infrastructure into production and prepare for ongoing management.

- **Tasks:**
  - **Final Configuration Check:** Ensure all configurations are correct and optimized.
  - **Documentation:** Create and hand over detailed documentation for the IT team, including maintenance procedures and troubleshooting guides.
  - **Training:** Conduct training sessions for the IT team to manage the new infrastructure effectively.

- **Duration:** 1 week
- **Dependencies:** Testing phase completion, stakeholder sign-off
- **Key Resources:** Training team, documentation specialists

**Outcome:** A fully operational and well-documented infrastructure ready for ongoing management.

#### Phase 6: Ongoing Management

**Objective:** Continuously monitor and maintain the infrastructure to meet SLA requirements.

- **Tasks:**
  - **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring tools to track performance metrics (e.g., uptime, latency).
  - **Reporting:** Generate regular reports on infrastructure health and resource utilization.
  - **Maintenance:** Perform routine updates, patches, and maintenance activities as needed.
  - **Incident Management:** Provide support for any issues that arise outside of the change window.

- **Duration:** Ongoing
- **Dependencies:** Successful transition to production
- **Key Resources:** IT operations team, automation tools

**Outcome:** A stable and reliable infrastructure that consistently meets the 90% SLA requirements.
