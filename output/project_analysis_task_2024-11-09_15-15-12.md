**Detailed Report for IT Operational Support Solution**

The project plan for IT Operational Support Solution aims to design and implement a new IT operational support solution that meets the organization's requirements. The current state assessment reveals that the existing infrastructure is outdated and cannot meet the growing demands of the organization.

**Detailed Design Documents:**

1. Physical Hosts:
	* 30 physical hosts with a minimum of 2 CPUs, 8 GB RAM, and 256 GB storage each
	* Configuration: 10 x Intel Xeon E5-2670 v3 processors, 16 GB DDR4 RAM per host, 512 GB SSD + 512 GB HDD for total capacity of 1.25 TB
	* Vendor selection: HP ProLiant DL380 Gen9 servers with HP 2810 SmartCache SSDs and HP 6TB HDDs
2. Network Devices:
	* 30 network devices, including routers, switches, firewalls, and load balancers
	* Configuration: Cisco Nexus 9000 series switches, Juniper SRX300 series firewalls, Cisco ASR1000 series routers
	* Vendor selection: Cisco Systems Inc., Juniper Networks Inc.
3. HP Storage:
	* 40 TB of HP Storage with a minimum of 4 TB SSD and 36 TB HDD capacity
	* Configuration: HP StoreVirtual 4005 storage systems with 1TB SSD + 750GB HDD for total capacity of 40TB

**Virtualization Platform Design and Implementation:**

1. Virtualization Platform:
	* New virtualization platform with a minimum of 8 cores, 16 GB RAM, and 256 GB storage each
	* Vendor selection: VMware vSphere 7.0
2. Virtualization Platform Implementation:
	* Install VMware vSphere 7.0 on the new infrastructure
	* Configure vCenter Server and ESXi hosts for virtualization platform management

**Implementation and Testing of the New Infrastructure:**

1. Implement the new physical hosts, network devices, HP Storage, and virtualization platform
2. Test and validate the new infrastructure and virtualization platform to ensure compatibility and performance

**Deployment of the Final Solution:**

1. Deploy the final solution and conduct post-deployment activities
	* Document lessons learned and identify areas for improvement
	* Conduct regular backups and disaster recovery exercises

**Budget Breakdown:**

The estimated budget for this project is $500,000, broken down as follows:

* Equipment costs (physical hosts, network devices, HP Storage): $150,000
* Software costs (virtualization platform, backup software): $50,000
* Personnel costs (IT professionals, IT service manager): $100,000
* Training and miscellaneous: $200,000

**Conclusion:**

This project plan provides a detailed roadmap for designing and implementing an IT operational support solution that meets the organization's requirements. The proposed timeline, resources, and budget are designed to ensure successful delivery of the project within 12 weeks.

The final answer is a comprehensive report outlining the detailed design documents, virtualization platform design and implementation, implementation and testing of the new infrastructure, deployment of the final solution, and budget breakdown for the IT Operational Support Solution project.
