### Phase 1: Planning (Weeks 1-2)
**Objective:** Establish project scope, create a detailed plan, and secure resources.
**Tasks:**
1. Conduct a thorough analysis of the current hiring process.
   - Current process review meetings with HR and IT teams to understand existing workflows, pain points, and requirements.
   - Creation of a detailed process flowchart and documentation.
2. Develop a project charter.
   - Document project goals, objectives, stakeholders, deliverables, timelines, and budget.
3. Define project roles and responsibilities.
   - Create a team structure with clear job descriptions and reporting lines.
4. Create a risk management plan.
   - Identify potential risks and develop mitigation strategies.
5. Schedule weekly team meetings.
   - Set up regular check-ins to monitor progress, address issues, and ensure alignment.

### Phase 2: Design (Weeks 3-4)
**Objective:** Design the user interface and develop the necessary components.
**Tasks:**
1. Create wireframes and mockups for the hiring portal.
   - Collaborate with UX/UI designers to create intuitive and user-friendly designs.
   - Use tools like Figma, Adobe XD, or Sketch.
2. Develop the backend architecture for the interview scheduling system.
   - Design RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js.
   - Implement real-time communication using WebSockets or Socket.io.
3. Design the requirement tracking module.
   - Create a database schema using MySQL or MongoDB.
   - Define data models, relationships, and queries.
4. Create a prototype of the reporting dashboard.
   - Utilize tools like Power BI or Tableau for data visualization.
   - Ensure that the dashboard is interactive and user-friendly.

### Phase 3: Development (Weeks 5-16)
**Objective:** Implement the designed components and integrate them into a cohesive system.
**Tasks:**
1. Develop the hiring portal using React.js.
   - Set up the project environment using Create React App.
   - Build components for job listings, application forms, and user profiles.
2. Implement real-time scheduling for interviews using Firebase or MongoDB.
   - Utilize Firebase Realtime Database or MongoDB Atlas for real-time data synchronization.
   - Develop APIs for adding, updating, and deleting interview slots.
3. Requirement Tracking Module Development
   - Create API endpoints for managing requirements.
   - Implement features such as creating, editing, and deleting requirements.
   - Ensure proper validation and error handling.
4. Reporting Dashboard Development
   - Connect the reporting dashboard to the backend database.
   - Develop queries to retrieve relevant data for reports.
   - Ensure that dashboards are updated in real-time using WebSockets.

### Phase 4: Testing (Weeks 17-20)
**Objective:** Conduct user acceptance testing and ensure system reliability.
**Tasks:**
1. User Acceptance Testing (UAT):
   - Engage HR and IT teams to test the system in a simulated production environment.
   - Collect feedback on usability, functionality, and performance.
   - Identify and document any issues or bugs.
2. Regression Testing:
   - Re-test all components after fixes are implemented.
   - Ensure that existing functionalities are not broken during changes.
3. Load Testing:
   - Simulate high traffic scenarios to test system scalability and reliability.
   - Use tools like JMeter or Gatling for load testing.

### Phase 5: Deployment (Weeks 21-22)
**Objective:** Deploy the system to a production environment and conduct final training.
**Tasks:**
1. Prepare the production environment:
   - Set up servers using Docker containers.
   - Configure CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins or GitLab CI.
   - Ensure that all dependencies are properly installed and configured.
2. Conduct final training for stakeholders:
   - Provide comprehensive training sessions for HR and IT teams.
   - Cover system usage, best practices, and support procedures.
3. Launch the system to production.

### Phase 6: Post-Deployment Monitoring (Weeks 23-24)
**Objective:** Monitor the system's performance and address any issues that arise.
**Tasks:**
1. Set up monitoring tools:
   - Utilize tools like Prometheus, Grafana, or New Relic for real-time monitoring.
   - Define key performance indicators (KPIs) to track system health.
2. Collect feedback from stakeholders:
   - Regularly check in with HR and IT teams to gather user feedback.
   - Address any issues or concerns that arise.
3. Perform periodic maintenance:
   - Update dependencies and fix security vulnerabilities.
   - Ensure that the system remains up-to-date with the latest technologies.
