### Phase 4: Testing (Weeks 17-20)
**Objective:** Conduct thorough testing to ensure the system is functional and meets all requirements.
**Tasks:**
1. Conduct unit tests on individual components.
2. Perform integration testing across modules.
3. User acceptance testing (UAT) with key stakeholders.
4. Fix any identified bugs or issues.

### Phase 5: Deployment and Training (Weeks 21-22)
**Objective:** Deploy the system to production and provide training to end-users.
**Tasks:**
1. Set up the production environment.
2. Migrate data from testing environments to production.
3. Conduct training sessions for project managers, HR staff, and interviewers.
4. Provide documentation and support resources.

### Phase 6: Post-Deployment Monitoring (Weeks 23-24)
**Objective:** Monitor the system's performance and make necessary adjustments.
**Tasks:**
1. Collect user feedback.
2. Analyze system metrics for performance improvement.
3. Address any issues that arise post-deployment.
4. Implement additional features based on user needs.
