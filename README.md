# prastavAI-Solution-Builder
This project is build with the help of CrewAI to build solutions and prepare required documentation based on different agentic workflows. This project is still in development and looking forward for support to bring as solution for different areas which LLM can build with the help of different tools like internet search, calculation required 


# prastavAI-Solution-Builder

This project leverages CrewAI to build comprehensive solutions and generate necessary documentation based on various agentic workflows.  It's currently under active development and welcomes contributions to expand its capabilities across diverse problem domains where Large Language Models (LLMs) can be effectively utilized in conjunction with external tools.

## Overview

prastavAI-Solution-Builder aims to streamline the process of developing solutions by automating key tasks through agent-based workflows.  It utilizes LLMs to reason, plan, and execute steps, leveraging tools like internet search and computational capabilities to achieve desired outcomes.  The project focuses on generating not only the solution itself, but also the associated documentation, making it easier to understand, implement, and maintain.

## Features (Planned/In Development)

* **Agentic Workflows:** Define complex tasks as a series of agent interactions, enabling the system to break down problems into manageable steps.
* **LLM Integration:** Utilize the power of LLMs for reasoning, planning, and natural language processing.
* **Tool Integration:** Integrate with external tools like internet search engines, calculators, and other APIs to enhance the capabilities of the agents.
* **Automated Documentation:** Generate comprehensive documentation for the developed solutions, including explanations, code snippets, and usage instructions.
* **Customizable Solutions:**  Design and implement solutions tailored to specific problem domains.
* **Extensible Framework:**  Easily add new agents, tools, and workflows to expand the project's functionality.

## Getting Started (Example - Adjust as needed)

1. **Prerequisites:**
    * Python 3.x
    * `crewai` library (Install with `pip install crewai`)
    * Other dependencies (List them here as you add them.  Example: `pip install requests beautifulsoup4`)
    * API Keys (If required for external tools, specify how to obtain and configure them. Example:  "Obtain an API key from [Tool Provider] and set it as an environment variable named `TOOL_API_KEY`.")

2. **Installation:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)[your-username]/prastavAI-Solution-Builder.git
    cd prastavAI-Solution-Builder
    # Create a virtual environment (recommended)
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt # Create this file and list your project dependencies
    ```

3. **Usage (Example - Replace with your actual usage instructions):**
    ```bash
    crewai run
    ```

## Agent Framework

This project utilizes a modular agent-based architecture to build and manage solutions.  The following agents are planned or under development:

### I. Planning Agents

These agents focus on defining and structuring the project.

* **Strategic Planning Agent:** Sets the overall goals, objectives, and strategic direction of the project.  Interfaces with business stakeholders and defines the scope.
* **Service Planning Agent:** Focuses specifically on the service lifecycle, including initiation, operation, monitoring, and eventual closure.
* **Transition Planning Agent:** Handles the transition of the project from development to operational use, ensuring a smooth handoff.

### II. Solution Expert Agents

These agents design, build, and manage the actual solution.

* **Solution Architect Agent:** Designs the technical architecture of the solution, including components, interfaces, and data flow.
* **Project Manager Agent:** Manages the project execution, tracks progress, handles deviations, and ensures timely completion.  Orchestrates other solution agents.
* **Risk Management Agent:** Identifies, assesses, and mitigates potential risks throughout the project lifecycle.
* **Lessons Learned Agent:** Captures and documents lessons learned during the project for future improvement.
* **Operational Support Agent:** Handles the ongoing operation and maintenance of the solution after it's deployed.  Deals with operational deviations and analyzes performance.

### III. Documentation Agents

These agents automate the creation of various types of project documentation.

* **Documentation Agent (General):** This core agent orchestrates the other specialized documentation agents and handles overall documentation generation.  It may also generate high-level overview documents.

* **API Documentation Agent:**  Specifically designed to create API documentation, including endpoint descriptions, request/response formats, and usage examples.  Could use tools like Swagger or OpenAPI.

* **User Manual Agent:** Generates user manuals and guides, explaining how to use the developed solutions.  Focuses on clarity and ease of understanding for end-users.

* **Technical Documentation Agent:** Creates technical documentation for developers and maintainers, including architecture diagrams, code documentation, and deployment instructions.

* **Requirements Documentation Agent:** Generates documentation related to the project requirements, including user stories, use cases, and functional specifications.  This agent might interface with requirements management tools.

* **Testing Documentation Agent:** Creates documentation related to testing activities, including test plans, test cases, test results, and bug reports.

* **Deployment Documentation Agent:**  Focuses on generating documentation related to the deployment process, including server setup, configuration instructions, and troubleshooting guides.

* **Code Documentation Agent:** Extracts comments and other information from the code to generate code documentation.  Could use tools like Sphinx or JSDoc.

**Agent Interaction (Conceptual):**

The Documentation Agent (General) acts as a central point for documentation generation.  It can call upon the specialized agents as needed.  For example, when API documentation is required, it will invoke the API Documentation Agent.  The interaction details will be further defined as the project progresses.

### IV. Financial Agents

These agents manage the financial aspects of the project.

* **Cost Management Agent:** Estimates and manages project costs.
* **Revenue Management Agent:** Plans and manages revenue generation from the solution.
* **Profitability Agent:** Analyzes and optimizes the profitability of the project.

**Agent Interaction (Conceptual):**

The agents are designed to interact with each other to achieve project goals.  For example, the Strategic Planning Agent provides input to the Service Planning Agent and the Solution Architect Agent. The Project Manager Agent orchestrates the Solution Expert Agents, and so on.  A detailed interaction diagram will be developed as the project progresses.

**Current Status:**

The agent framework is currently under development.  We are actively working on implementing the core agents and defining their interactions.  Contributions and suggestions for new agents are welcome!
